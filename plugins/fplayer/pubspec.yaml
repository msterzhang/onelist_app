flutter:
  # This section identifies this Flutter project as a plugin project.
  # The 'pluginClass' specifies the class (in Java, Kotlin, Swift, Objective-C, etc.)
  # which should be registered in the plugin registry. This is required for
  # using method channels.
  # The Android 'package' specifies package in which the registered class is.
  # This is required for using method channels on Android.
  # The 'ffiPlugin' specifies that native code should be built and bundled.
  # This is required for using `dart:ffi`.
  # All these are used by the tooling to maintain consistency when
  # adding or updating assets for this project.

  # To add assets to your plugin package, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # To add custom fonts to your plugin package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
